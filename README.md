## Architecture

```
User uploads PDF

Vercel Blob Storage (temporary)
       ↓
QStash triggers async extraction
       ↓
OpenAI extracts metrics from PDF
       ↓
User reviews & confirms
       ↓
Neon Postgres (permanent storage)

PDF deleted from Blob
```

## Local Development

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` with:

```env
# Database
NEON_DATABASE_URL=postgres://...

# Auth
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret

# AI & Storage
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your-vercel-blob-token

# Async Processing
QSTASH_TOKEN=your-qstash-token
QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY=your-signing-key
QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY=your-next-signing-key

# Error Tracking
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your-sentry-dsn
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests (Jest)

```bash
cd web
npm test
```

### E2E Tests (Playwright)

End-to-end tests run against a real dev server and database. They seed a dummy test user (`e2e-test@viziai.test`), exercise the UI in a real browser, and clean up after themselves.

```bash
cd web
npx playwright test          # headless
npx playwright test --headed # watch it run
npx playwright show-report   # view HTML report
```

Requires `.env.local` with `NEON_DATABASE_URL` and `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`.

### CI

E2E tests run automatically on every **pull request to `main`** via GitHub Actions. The workflow installs Chromium, starts the dev server, runs the tests, and uploads the Playwright report as an artifact if anything fails.

The `NEON_DATABASE_URL` secret must be set in GitHub repo settings under Settings > Secrets > Actions.

## Database Schema

- **profiles**: Family member profiles
- **reports**: Blood test reports with sample dates
- **metrics**: Individual test values (Hemoglobin, etc.)
- **metric_preferences**: Display order and favorites per profile
- **processed_files**: Upload tracking (prevents duplicates)
- **pending_uploads**: In-progress upload state
- **metric_aliases**: Global alias map for metric name normalization
