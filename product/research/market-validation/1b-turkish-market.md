# Turkish Market Research

**Date:** 2026-02-22

---

## Key Finding

**There is NO product in Turkey that does what ViziAI does** — upload a Turkish lab PDF, extract values with AI, and track trends over time with per-metric charts. ViziAI is effectively unique in this market.

---

## Turkish Competitors

### TahliLET (tahlilet.com) — Closest Competitor

- AI-powered lab result interpretation. Upload PDF/JPG/PNG.
- Has "12-month comparison" for tracking indicators over time
- 5,000+ users, 4.8/5 rating
- Built specifically for Turkish market
- **Key difference vs ViziAI:** More focused on one-off AI interpretation ("what do my results mean?") than structured long-term trend tracking with per-metric charts

### Tahlil Pro (tahlilpro.com)

- AI analysis of blood tests, urine, MRI/CT reports
- Claims 7 billion medical datasets
- **Website was unreachable during research** — reliability concerns
- No clear trend tracking feature

### Kantesti (kantesti.net)

- German company, 75+ languages including Turkish
- Claims 2M+ users globally
- EUR 6.24/report or EUR 59.90/year (trend analysis only on annual)
- **Not Turkey-specific** — generic global product, not optimized for Turkish lab formats
- Has a crypto token (ERC-20) — raises credibility questions

### Tahlil.com / Tahlilmatik

- Manual entry only, 12 pre-defined test categories
- Basic normal/abnormal feedback
- Free, but extremely limited — not a real competitor

---

## e-Nabız (enabiz.gov.tr) — Government System

- **76+ million users** (virtually all Turkish citizens)
- National personal health records aggregating all health data from public + private facilities
- **Has trend graphs** — "Karşılaştır" (Compare) button for graphical comparison across time

### Critical Problems (from Şikayetvar complaints):

- **Missing results** — widespread complaints about lab results not appearing
- **Data gaps** — some hospitals/labs don't upload consistently
- **Broken graphs** — after updates, comparison features reportedly broken
- **No response to complaints** — hasn't responded to any Şikayetvar complaints in past year
- **No PDF upload** — only shows data from integrated facilities
- **Private lab gaps** — results from some private labs and checkup centers may not appear

### ViziAI Positioning Against e-Nabız:

_"e-Nabız'da görünmeyen tahlilleriniz"_ (Your test results that don't show up in e-Nabız)

## Private Hospital/Lab Portals — All Siloed

| Portal            | Network Only  | Trend Tracking      | Cross-Lab |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| Acıbadem Mobil    | Acıbadem only | Basic (BP, glucose) | No        |
| Memorial E-Sonuç  | Memorial only | No                  | No        |
| SYNLAB Turkey     | SYNLAB only   | No                  | No        |
| Düzen Laboratuvar | Düzen only    | No                  | No        |
| Synevo Turkey     | Synevo only   | No                  | No        |

**The fragmentation problem:** A patient with tests from Acıbadem (January), Memorial (April), and a state hospital (July) has **three separate systems with no unified view**.

---

## How Turkish Patients Receive Results

1. **State hospitals:** Upload to e-Nabız (eventually). Paper printouts common.
2. **Private hospitals:** Proprietary apps/portals + e-Nabız (varying reliability). PDF printouts/emails common.
3. **Private labs:** Own portals. PDF commonly emailed or downloadable.
4. **Checkup centers:** Comprehensive PDF reports. May or may not integrate with e-Nabız.
5. **Paper:** Still common, especially smaller clinics and state hospitals.

**The PDF is the universal format.** Regardless of source, patients almost always end up with a PDF. This is exactly what ViziAI targets.

---

## Cultural Context

- **Check-up culture is strong** — private hospitals aggressively market annual check-up packages
- **Regular blood testing is common** — chronic conditions, company-mandated checks, family monitoring
- **Doctor-dependent interpretation** — dominant pattern is: get blood test → take to doctor → doctor interprets. Self-tracking not culturally mainstream.
- **Biohacking/QS:** Very niche in Turkey. Mainly urban, English-speaking tech professionals in Istanbul.
- **Family health management is deeply embedded** — adult children routinely manage parents' health, accompany to appointments, collect results. They use **WhatsApp to share PDF screenshots** or keep paper folders. **No dedicated tool exists for this.**

## Turkish Diaspora Opportunity (5-6M in Western Europe)

| Country     | Turkish-Origin Population |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| Germany     | ~3 million                |
| France      | ~700,000                  |
| UK          | ~500,000                  |
| Netherlands | ~500,000                  |
| Belgium     | ~250,000                  |
| **Total**   | **~5-6 million**          |

### The Multi-Language Lab Report Problem

A study of Turkish patients in German hospitals found:

- **25.6%** rated their German skills as "very bad" or "bad"
- **46.3%** estimated their understanding of medical information as "average" or worse
- **43.3%** said an interpreter would have helped "much" or "very much"

**Unmet need:** Turkish person in Germany gets blood tests at a German lab → report comes in German → they want to understand it, compare with Turkish results, share with family in Turkey. **No product solves this.**

## ViziAI's Unique Position in Turkey

| Feature                      | ViziAI              | TahliLET            | e-Nabız           | Kantesti         |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| Upload Turkish lab PDFs      | Yes                 | Yes                 | No (auto-ingest)  | Yes (generic)    |
| AI extraction                | Yes (GPT-4o Vision) | Yes                 | N/A               | Yes              |
| Per-metric trend graphs      | Yes                 | 12-month comparison | Broken/unreliable | Annual plan only |
| Turkish metric normalization | Yes (alias system)  | Unknown             | N/A               | No               |
| Family profile management    | Yes                 | No                  | No                | No               |
| Multi-language support       | Yes                 | No                  | No                | Yes (75+ langs)  |

### Competitive Moat

The metric name normalization system (alias table handling "Potasiyum" vs "POTASYUM (SERUM/PLAZMA)" vs "Potaszyum") is a data-driven moat. Any competitor would need to build the same knowledge base of Turkish metric name variants.

---

## Strategic Implications

1. **ViziAI is genuinely unique in Turkey** — no product combines PDF upload + AI extraction + structured trend tracking + Turkish metric normalization + family profiles
2. **e-Nabız's failures are ViziAI's opportunity** — position as the reliable alternative for results that don't show up or can't be compared
3. **Family health management is culturally resonant** — lean into "ailenizin sağlığı için" (for your family's health)
4. **Diaspora is a high-value growth vector** — 5-6M people with the multi-language problem, higher tech adoption, strong health ties to Turkey
5. **Monitor TahliLET** — only Turkish product that could evolve into a direct competitor
6. **The PDF is universal** — every Turkish patient ends up with PDFs regardless of source, validating ViziAI's approach
