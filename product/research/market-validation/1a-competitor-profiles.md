## Platform Strategy: Is Web-Only a Disadvantage?

### No. The data says web-first may be the better bet.

**1. Mobile competitors are struggling.**

- Best mobile app (Carrot Care): 143 ratings in 6 years
- BloodTrends: 2 ratings
- Health3: 0 ratings
- Lab Tracker: 3 ratings at 2.7 stars
- mySmartBlood: 2 ratings at 1.0 stars

This is NOT a category where mobile apps are thriving.

**2. The use case fits web.**
Blood tests arrive as PDFs. Users are at a computer when they receive results. The workflow is "receive PDF → upload → review → track." This is a sit-down analysis task, not a quick mobile check.

**3. Web enables things mobile can't easily match.**

- PDF upload is more natural on web
- Data-dense trend dashboards need larger screens
- Family sharing works better on web
- No App Store 30% tax
- Instant updates without App Store review

**4. Best-funded player validates web-first.**
Heads Up Health ($20M+) is web-first with mobile companion.

**5. Newest entrants chose web.**
SiPhox Sai (YC-backed) and BloodTrack launched web-only.

### Where web-only hurts:

- **No camera OCR** for paper reports (relevant in Turkey)
- **No push notifications** for re-test reminders
- **No App Store discoverability** (though volumes are tiny in this category)

### Recommendation:

Stay web-first. Make mobile web excellent (responsive, PWA). Don't rush native apps — the mobile competitors prove there isn't meaningful App Store traction in this niche.
