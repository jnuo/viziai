# Actionable Insights from Competitor Analysis

## Platform & Product

**1. Stay web-first. Don't build native apps.**
Mobile competitors are all failing — Carrot Care has 143 ratings after 6 years. Best-funded player (Heads Up Health, $20M+) and newest YC-backed entrant (SiPhox Sai) both chose web-first. The workflow (receive PDF → upload → review trends) is a sit-down task. Make mobile web excellent (responsive, PWA) instead.

**2. PDF extraction quality is the #1 battleground.**
Top 2 user complaints across all competitors: manual entry tedium and PDF parsing failures. If ViziAI's GPT-4o extraction is reliable, that alone differentiates. Invest in making it bulletproof — especially for Turkish lab formats where no competitor performs well.

**3. Family profiles are an underserved need — nobody does this well.**
It's complaint #4 across all competitors. Lab Tracker is the only app that supports it, rated 2.7/5 with manual entry only. This is both the brand story (built for dad) and a real market gap.

**4. Keep interpretation concise and visual.**
Kantesti generates 40-45 page reports per blood test. Users find them overwhelming. Trend charts > walls of text. Clear, calm, visual.

## Positioning

**5. The 4-feature combo is the moat — lean into it.**
No single competitor has: lab-agnostic PDF upload + AI extraction + family profiles + Turkish support. Don't dilute by chasing bio-age calculators or wearable integrations yet.

**6. Don't position as "another tracker."**
The tracking niche is tiny and struggling globally. The edge is being the family-first, lab-agnostic, Turkish-speaking tracker that solves the fragmentation problem.

## Global Market

**7. Price in the $5-10/month range or ~$60/year.**
Pure tracking apps are free or sub-$10/year — race to the bottom. Premium pricing ($200+/yr) only works with bundled blood tests. BloodTrack charges $9.95-19.95/mo for a similar web-only product in Australia. Mid-tier is the sweet spot: justified by AI extraction + family profiles.

**8. The diaspora is a high-value niche nobody serves.**
5-6M Turks in Western Europe getting lab results in German/Dutch/French, wanting to understand them and share with family in Turkey. Zero products solve this. Multi-language support is already built into ViziAI.

**9. Watch exactly 2 global competitors:**

- **BloodTrack (Australia)** — closest model (web-only, PDF upload, AI extraction). Small (1,000 users) but validating the same approach.
- **SiPhox Sai (YC-backed)** — "Cursor for Lab Test Results." Web-only, conversational AI sidebar. Could expand beyond their test kit ecosystem.

## Turkish Market

**10. Position against e-Nabız.**
76M users on a government system with broken trend graphs, missing results, and zero customer support. Marketing writes itself: _"e-Nabız'da görünmeyen tahlilleriniz"_ (your results that don't show up in e-Nabız).

**11. The PDF is universal in Turkey.**
State hospitals, private hospitals, private labs, checkup centers — regardless of source, patients end up with a PDF. This validates ViziAI's approach completely.

**12. Family health management is culturally embedded.**
Adult children routinely manage parents' health, share results via WhatsApp screenshots, keep paper folders. No dedicated tool exists for this. _"Ailenizin sağlığı için"_ (for your family's health) resonates.

**13. Hospital portal fragmentation is real.**
A patient with tests from Acıbadem (January), Memorial (April), and a state hospital (July) has three separate systems with no unified view. ViziAI is the unifier.

**14. Watch exactly 1 Turkish competitor:**

- **TahliLET** — 5,000 users, AI interpretation of Turkish PDFs. More one-shot interpretation than structured tracking, but they could pivot toward trend tracking.

## Not Now, But Later

Features to keep on the roadmap but not build yet:

- Bio-age calculation (3 competitors have it — becomes table stakes eventually)
- AI chat / follow-up Q&A (SiPhox Sai does this well)
- Camera OCR for paper reports (relevant for Turkey, not urgent)
- Push notifications / re-test reminders
- Wearable integrations

## The Bottom Line

The market is real ($5-6B, 19-22% CAGR) but the tracking niche specifically is tiny and struggling. ViziAI's wedge isn't being a better tracker — it's solving the fragmentation problem (e-Nabız gaps, hospital silos, diaspora language barriers) for families, in a market where no one else does.
