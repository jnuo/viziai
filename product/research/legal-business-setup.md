## Options to Research

### Spain (Autónomo)

- €80/month first year, ~€250/month after
- Quarterly VAT + income tax filings
- Stripe works, need gestor (~€70/month)
- E-invoicing requirement coming July 2026
- Digital Kit grant up to €3,000 available
- Total cost Year 1: ~€150/month

### Estonia (e-Residency) — TODO: Research

- Fully online company setup, no physical presence needed
- Popular with digital nomads / location-independent founders
- EU company, can use Stripe, accept EU payments
- ~€100 setup + €200/year government fee + service provider fees
- Question: how does this interact with Spanish tax residency?

### Other Options — TODO: Research

- [ ] US LLC (Stripe Atlas, Delaware — common for SaaS)
- [ ] Compare: setup cost, ongoing cost, tax implications for Spanish tax resident
