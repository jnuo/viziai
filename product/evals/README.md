## After Evals Are Running

- [ ] **Model cost optimization** — benchmark cheaper models (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4.1-nano) against the eval suite. Use evals to find the cheapest model that still passes quality thresholds. Currently on `gpt-4o`.

## Method

Following the walkthrough in `RoboPM/second-brain/learning/evals/eval-helper.md`.
