# ViziAI — Segments, Needs, Channels

**Last updated:** 2026-03-01

## What ViziAI Does

Upload lab PDFs → AI extracts values → track & visualize over time → share with family.

## What ViziAI Does NOT Do

No health interpretation, no medical advice, no value commentary.

## Core Jobs to Be Done

1. **Consolidation** — all results in one place, any lab, any country
2. **Track over time** — how has a metric changed across months/years?
3. **Quick lookup** — when was the last time vitamin D was checked?
4. **Doctor prep** — review recent values before an appointment, know what to ask
5. **Self-tracking** — weight, blood pressure trends with clean visualization

- See lab reports in Turkish regardless of source language (German, Dutch, French)
- Answer "when was dad's last vitamin D test?" without digging through PDFs

**Value prop:** PDF'i yukle, grafiklerini gor, ailece paylas. e-Nabiz'da gorünmeyen tahlillerin de burada.
