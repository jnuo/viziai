If you've ever moved between countries or traveled for extended periods, you know the frustration: you get blood work done abroad, and the report looks completely different from what you're used to back home. Different metric names, different units, different formatting. Keeping a unified view of your health over time becomes a puzzle with mismatched pieces.

This is exactly the problem ViziAI was built to solve.

## Why Tracking Blood Tests Across Borders Is Hard

Blood test reports vary significantly from country to country. Here are some of the common challenges:

### Metric Names Change by Language

The same lab value can appear under different names depending on the country and language. For example:

- **Potassium** in English becomes **Potasyum** in Turkish, **Kalium** in German, and **Potasio** in Spanish
- **White Blood Cell Count** might appear as **WBC**, **Lökosit**, **Leukozyten**, or **Leucocitos**
- **Thyroid Stimulating Hormone** could be listed as **TSH**, **Tiroid Stimülan Hormon**, or **Thyreotropin**

Even within the same language, different labs use different conventions. One Turkish lab might report "ALT" while another writes out "Alanin Aminotransferaz (ALT)".

### Units Can Differ

Some countries prefer mg/dL for glucose while others use mmol/L. Reference ranges also shift depending on the lab's methodology and population norms. Without careful attention, you might think a value has changed dramatically when it's simply been measured in a different unit.

### PDF Formats Are Inconsistent

Every lab has its own PDF template. Tables, columns, headers, and footnotes are arranged differently. Some labs use scanned images rather than digital text, making extraction even harder. Manually copying values from these PDFs into a spreadsheet is tedious and error-prone.

## How ViziAI Handles Multi-Country Blood Tests

ViziAI combines AI-powered PDF extraction with a curated alias system to create a seamless experience, regardless of where your blood test was performed.

### Step 1: Upload Any Lab PDF

Simply upload your blood test PDF — whether it's from a clinic in Istanbul, a hospital in Berlin, or a lab in Madrid. ViziAI accepts PDFs in any language. The upload takes seconds.

### Step 2: AI Extracts Your Results

ViziAI uses advanced AI to read your PDF and extract every metric, value, unit, and reference range. The AI understands multiple languages and can handle both digital and scanned PDFs. It identifies metric names, numeric values, and reference ranges even from complex table layouts.

### Step 3: Smart Name Normalization

This is where the magic happens. ViziAI maintains a curated database of metric aliases — hundreds of mappings that connect variant names to their canonical form. When your German lab report says "Kalium", ViziAI automatically recognizes it as the same thing as "Potasyum" from your Turkish report.

During the review step, you see exactly what ViziAI suggests. Each rename is shown inline with a toggle, so you stay in control. Accept the suggestion or keep the original name — it's your choice.

### Step 4: Unified Dashboard

Once confirmed, your results appear on a single dashboard alongside all your previous tests. Trend charts show how each metric has changed over time, regardless of which country the test came from. Out-of-range values are highlighted so you can spot issues at a glance.

## Real-World Example: Moving from Turkey to Germany

Imagine you've been getting blood tests in Turkey for years. Your reports list metrics like "Potasyum", "Glukoz", "TSH", and "Hemoglobin". You move to Germany, and your new lab reports show "Kalium", "Glukose", "TSH" (same abbreviation, luckily), and "Hämoglobin".

Without ViziAI, you'd need to manually figure out which German name maps to which Turkish name, then track both in a spreadsheet. With ViziAI, you simply upload both PDFs. The alias system connects "Kalium" to "Potasyum", "Glukose" to "Glukoz", and so on. Your dashboard shows one continuous trend line per metric.

## Supported Languages

ViziAI currently supports lab reports in:

- **Turkish** — the language ViziAI was originally built for
- **English** — widely used in international clinics
- **German** — with 55+ alias mappings for common lab metrics
- **French** — with 59+ alias mappings
- **Spanish** — for reports from Spain and Latin America

The alias database grows with every upload pattern we identify. If your report uses a name we haven't seen before, you can keep it as-is during review and it will still be tracked correctly.

## Privacy and Security

Your health data stays private. ViziAI uses AI only to extract values from your PDF — the AI does not store or learn from your data. All results are stored securely in our database, and you can export or delete your data at any time. Read our [privacy policy](/privacy) for full details.
