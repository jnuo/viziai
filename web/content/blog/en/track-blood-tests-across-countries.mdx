Moving between countries shouldn't mean losing track of your health data. Whether you're an expat, a frequent traveler, or someone who gets lab work done in different countries, keeping a unified view of your blood test results can be challenging.

## The Problem: Different Names for the Same Thing

Every country has its own conventions for naming lab metrics. What's called "Potassium" in an English-speaking lab might appear as "Potasyum" in Turkey, "Kalium" in Germany, or "Potassium" (with different formatting) in France. The values and units might also differ.

This makes it nearly impossible to track trends over time if you're comparing reports from different countries side by side.

## How ViziAI Solves This

ViziAI uses AI-powered PDF extraction combined with a curated alias system to normalize metric names across languages. When you upload a blood test PDF — regardless of the language — ViziAI:

1. **Extracts values** from the PDF using AI that understands multiple languages
2. **Normalizes metric names** using our alias database that maps variants to canonical names
3. **Shows suggestions** during the review step so you stay in control
4. **Tracks trends** across all your reports in a unified dashboard
