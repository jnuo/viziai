## 2026-02-28 - STORY-001: Add typecheck script
- Added "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit" to web/package.json scripts
- Installed @types/jest (was missing, causing typecheck failures in test files)
- Excluded e2e/ from tsconfig.json and jest.config.js (Playwright tests were leaking into tsc and Jest)
- Verified: typecheck passes (0 errors), tests pass (15/15), build succeeds
- Files changed: web/package.json, web/package-lock.json, web/tsconfig.json, web/jest.config.js
- Learnings: e2e tests need to be excluded from both tsconfig and Jest config — they use Playwright's own type system and test runner

## 2026-02-28 - STORY-002: Add German locale
- Added 'de' locale to i18n config (label: Deutsch, BCP47: de-DE)
- Created web/messages/de.json with all 334 keys translated to German
- Key structure verified identical to en.json via script comparison
- Files changed: web/src/i18n/config.ts, web/messages/de.json
- Learnings: Use node script to verify key parity between locale files — catches structural mismatches before build

---
## 2026-02-28 - STORY-003: Add French locale
- Added 'fr' locale to i18n config (label: Français, BCP47: fr-FR)
- Created web/messages/fr.json with all 334 keys translated to French
- Key structure verified identical to en.json
- Files changed: web/src/i18n/config.ts, web/messages/fr.json
- Learnings: Same pattern as STORY-002 — locale additions are mechanical once the first one is done

## 2026-02-28 - STORY-006: German metric aliases migration
- Created db-schema/migrations/20260228_german_metric_aliases.sql with 55 German → Turkish alias mappings
- Covers: CBC, metabolic panel, liver, kidney, lipids, thyroid, iron, inflammation, vitamins, coagulation
- Used ON CONFLICT (alias) DO NOTHING for idempotent re-runs
- Files changed: db-schema/migrations/20260228_german_metric_aliases.sql
- Learnings: Canonical names include full parenthetical suffixes like "ALT (Alanin Aminotransferaz)" — must match exactly

---
## 2026-02-28 - STORY-007: French metric aliases migration
- Created db-schema/migrations/20260228_french_metric_aliases.sql with 59 French → Turkish alias mappings
- Same coverage as German: CBC, metabolic, liver, kidney, lipids, thyroid, iron, inflammation, vitamins, coagulation
- Files changed: db-schema/migrations/20260228_french_metric_aliases.sql
- Learnings: French medical terms often use accented characters (é, è, ê) — important for correct alias matching

## 2026-02-28 - STORY-004: Report cap enforcement — backend
- Added 5-report-per-profile cap check to POST /api/upload, after profile access verification and before file processing
- Counts existing reports in processed_files table; returns 403 with reportCount and reportCap if >= 5
- Added translation keys to all 5 locale files: api.reportCapReached, pages.upload.reportCapReached, pages.upload.reportCapDescription, pages.dashboard.reportCount
- Code review found: race condition (concurrent uploads can bypass cap) — acceptable risk for personal health app with <5 users; error string casing inconsistency — fixed
- Verified: typecheck passes, tests pass (15/15), build succeeds
- Files changed: web/src/app/api/upload/route.ts, web/messages/tr.json, web/messages/en.json, web/messages/es.json, web/messages/de.json, web/messages/fr.json
- Learnings: Cap check placed before file read/upload to avoid wasting resources. Response includes reportCount/reportCap for STORY-005 frontend consumption

## 2026-02-28 - STORY-010: Blog infrastructure with locale-prefixed routing
- Set up MDX blog with path-based locale routing (/[locale]/blog/[slug]) for SEO
- Installed next-mdx-remote, gray-matter, @tailwindcss/typography
- Created blog utility library (web/src/lib/blog.ts) with path traversal protection
- Blog listing page with semantic HTML (ul/li, time elements), WCAG AA accessibility
- Article page with MDX rendering, reading time, description, hreflang alternates, CTA
- Static generation via generateStaticParams + dynamicParams=false (prevents DoS)
- Placeholder articles in EN and TR to verify cross-locale hreflang linking
- Design review loop: 3 agents (Brand, A11y, Design Quality) — required 2 iterations
- Code review: security (path boundary), performance (deduplicate alternates), architecture (route collision risk)
- Verified: typecheck passes, tests pass (15/15), build succeeds with all routes SSG
- Files changed: web/src/lib/blog.ts, web/src/app/[locale]/layout.tsx, web/src/app/[locale]/blog/page.tsx, web/src/app/[locale]/blog/[slug]/page.tsx, web/src/app/globals.css, web/src/app/layout.tsx, web/package.json, web/content/blog/en/*.mdx, web/content/blog/tr/*.mdx
- Learnings:
  - Tailwind v4 uses @plugin directive for JS plugins in CSS, not @import
  - Path-based locale routes can coexist with cookie-based next-intl — but <html lang> comes from cookie, not URL (known limitation, would require layout restructuring to fix)
  - [locale] dynamic segment captures any single-segment path — document this risk for future route additions
  - Static generation (generateStaticParams + dynamicParams=false) eliminates runtime file I/O and prevents resource exhaustion attacks
  - Inline locale Records are correct for path-based locale pages — useTranslations() reads from cookie, not URL param
